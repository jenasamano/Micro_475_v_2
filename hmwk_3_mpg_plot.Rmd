I am adding the library command to the setup so it loads the tidyverse with the setup.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

lots of problems not sure why this wouldn't make a bar graph my ufo sightings data I will try to add my csv file for ufo sightings the command is read.csv I put this under the library commands.Then you can try adding the shape and duration plot once again.

```{r plot, echo=TRUE}
mpg_plot <- ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
print(mpg_plot)
```
