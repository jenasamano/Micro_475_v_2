# Introduction

Presenting scientific data today there is a press to be correct and taken seriously. Data is presented without drama or flair and eschew any hint of entertainment. In the converted effort to be solemnly relevant we spend time in consideration of ink/data ratios which are based on monetary consideration as opposed to ease of communication of information. Efficiency is correlational to how much information can go on a plot to save on that precious ink and space. The audience seems seldom considered as authors take Tufte’s conclusion, “Moreover, it is a frequent mistake in thinking about statistical graphics to underestimate the audience. Instead, why not assume that if you understand it, most other readers will too?” (Tufte, P. 137) as a concrete interpretation shoving on all manner of data into a plot, presuming that everyone understands the experiment and process that went into it. Data visualization can be complex/include a lot of data and I keep in mind Tufte’s discussion in Chp 1 about Minard’s graph of Napoleon’s army campaign against Russia. It is important that a graphic reveal and not obscure your data and tell a story about the data. This story is not sensational but one of facts because. The graphic should enhance without conflating and help guide the reader to whatever conclusion you are making about you research.

## The Successful Plot

A successful plot: 
The data sets mapped into the image are the Bridgemanite and Ringwoodite experiment results. 
The dislocation mobility, T, and water saturation are all continuous. They are not factors, they could be any of the values, and are not confined to a specific range.
The scale looks like a mean or average of the range of values. They apply a line of best fit according to that mean in order to show how most of the values fall along it and support their assessment that there is a negatively correlational relationship between the two.
This a geom_point() plot of dislocation mobility [y axis] of Bridgemanite, and Ringwoodite as it becomes more hydrous and at different temperatures [temp and hydration in x axis] (A,B) and then a comparison dislocation mobility [y-axis] to Temperature [x-axis] as a function of water saturation.

## The Unsuccessful Plot

**Overlapping data**: On the left side of the graph there is a significant comparison of all of the lines to the standard (?) values of bending vibration of water molecules in NAS glass. However NAS is not a standard they are values from the current experiment. Since this is the comparison that is vital perhaps a subset inlay of this section of the graph blown up? Would a graph of the results on their own and another one with the comparison have been more effective?

**Maximize data and ink ratio, within reason**: There is a lot of information in the graph and there are caveats discussed in the words below. These are all graphed in relation to water saturation but saturation isn’t on the graph it is mentioned in the words. 

**Axis labels**: Are not in proportion to the graph. Making them bigger will ease the reading.

**Misc**: There is changes in absorption spectra on the left side that isn’t discussed.
