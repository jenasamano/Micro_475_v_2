# Homework 4
Homework 4 writing script to do some simple math equations and learning to use functions and make these functions a plot.
#
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Calculting the sum
assigning a value to an object and adding two objects together
##

```{r}
a <- 3
b <- 2
print(a+b)
```

###Sum function
###

```{r}
sum(2,3)
```


###**Flights**
The code for the library addition might still be in my script I have issues correlating what I write in code with the result. This extra step lets me see the code and see the result together. This next step will add a plot to the code written thus far.
###

```{r}
AA_flights <- filter(flights, carrier == "AA")
```

flights is a data set inside the data frame nyc flights.

```{r}
ggplot(data= AA_flights, mapping = aes(x=dep_delay, y=arr_delay))+
  geom_point()
```
