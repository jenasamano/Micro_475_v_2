### Research Question
I am interested in how city mileage varies between model types. Do some models of cars get better gas mileage than others in the city?

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg, mapping = aes(x=model, y=cty))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme(axis.text.x= element_text(angle = 90))
```

### Conclusion
Larger vehicles like the SUV's and Trucks had terrible gas mileage.
Cars like the new beetle have a a larger range of gas mileage compared to the Ford F150 and Range Rover had a much narrower range.
